# SMART OKRs

SMART OKRs combines the strengths of SMART criteria for goals and the strengths of OKRs for management plans.

SMART criteria for goals:

- **Specific/Strategic**: target one area clearly, precisely, and explicitly.
- **Measurable/Motivating**: quantify progress toward success by using metrics.
- **Actionable/Ambitious**: able to start, sustain, and complete.
- **Relevant**: closely connected to what's happening and being considered.
- **Timely/Tactical**: occurring at a time that is favorable, reservable, and bounded.

OKRs for management plans:

- Objective: what we want to achieve, as a one-sentence summary.
- Key Result: how we produce progress and measure it with metrics.

## Quickstart

For a quickstart, here's a quick template and quick example. You can see many more examples further down on this page.

### SMART OKR example

Objective: Improve sales by 10%+ during calendar year 2026. Measure by weekly revenue. SMART: We have two sales channels, which are web sales and phone sales. We intend to track each channel as its own key result because this helps us when we run channel-specific experiments in each channel.

Key Result 1: Web sales up 5%+. Measure by weekly revenue coming directly to our website. SMART: To make this actionable, we need to create a web analytics step to track revenue per week, then show it in our web dashboard.

Key Result 2: Phone sales up 5%+. Measure by weekly revenue coming to our phone staff. SMART: This is relevant to our customer satisfaction initiatives, because we want our phone staff to ask one question about satisfaction "How satisfied are you with our products, on a scale of one to ten, where ten is best?".

## SMART

### Specific

Target one area clearly, precisely, and explicitly.

Questions that may help:

- Scope: What is in scope versus out of scope?
- Functionality: What are the inputs, people, processes, and outputs?
- Understanding: What is the terminology, ubiquitous language, etc.?
- Results: What are any objectives, outcomes, impacts?
- Phrasing: Can you use positive phrases and action verbs?

### Measurable

Quantify progress toward success by using metrics.

Questions that may help:

- What metrics are being used and why?
- How do measurements help manage the work and improve it?
- What are the key performance indicators?
- What are any leading indicators and lagging indicators?
- How do various stakeholders access the metrics?

### Actionable

Achievable and able to start, sustain, and complete.

Questions that may help:

- Who is working on this? List any roles, responsibilities, participants, etc.
- What resources are needed? List any inputs, materials, budgets, approvals, etc.
- How are the challenges? List any risks, assumptions, issues, dependencies, etc.

### Relevant

Closely connected to what's happening and being considered.

Questions that may help:

- Can you summarize the purpose, rationale, etc.?
- Can you summarize the context, connections, etc.?
- How does this relate to the participants, their roles, and goals?
- How does this interconnect with other work, such as positively or negatively?
- Can you describe the impact, in terms that relate to adjacent goals and plans?

### Timely

Occurring at a time that is favorable, reservable, and bounded.

Questions that may help:

- When does this start and finish? For example with dates, or weeks, or months?
- Why use this timing over others? For example a fixed duration or a deadline?
- How is the time reserved? For example allocated, scheduled, budgeted, etc.?
- Where can participants see a timeline, or calendar, or schedule, etc.?
- How do you track the time spent versus the work in progress?
- Is there anything important that happens before this or after this?

## OKRs

### What are OKRs?

OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results.

OKR is a method of defining objectives and tracking their outcomes:

- The Objective: what we want to achieve

- The Key Results: subparts that help us track how we're making progress

Purpose:

- OKRs connect objectives of organizations to teams to individuals, to improve organizational alignment.

- OKRs connect objectives to measurements, to improve evidence-based decision making and reduce bias.

- OKRs connect objectives to plans, to help each person build their professional development plan.

Ground rules:

- OKRs and their metrics are visible to the whole organization by default. This helps coworkers understand what everyone is doing, and thus how to work together toward goals.

- OKRs are aspirational and inspirational, thus not used for formal performance reviews nor compensation. This helps coworkers understand that OKRs are for motivation and not.

## What is an objective?

Your objective should be:

- Inspirational

  - Provide a sense of meaning and progress.

  - Skip anything such as a small percentage gain.

- Relatable

  - Use language that you coworkers know and like.

  - Skip abstract language and unfamiliar acronyms.

- Actionable by you independently

  - Your objective has to be truly yours.

  - You can’t have any excuse such as "That other team didn't do their work."

- Measurable by you independently

  - You have to know your progress status.

  - You can't have any excuse such as "That other team didn't measure it."

## What is a key result?

Key results take the inspirational and provide specific evidence.

Create key results by asking a simple question “how would we know if we met our objective?”

Typically you have 1-3 key results.

Metrics can be based on:

- Growth
- Engagement
- Revenue
- Performance
- Quality

For example, “Launch an Awesome MVP” might have KR’s of:

- Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 8/10
- 20% of users come back 2X in one week
- 10% conversion

## OKR purpose

Each OKR is better when it connects to the organization's vision, mission, values, and strategy. Use these tips to help.

- What is your vision statement, mission statement, values statement, and strategy statement?

- How does this OKR connect to the vision, mission, values, and strategy?

- Why are you choosing this specific OKR over any other?

## OKR systems

All high-performance OKR systems have commonalities.

Ability to track results on a quantitative basis:

- Key results are not general or subjective actions you plan to take.

- They should always include numbers to make it clear how much has been achieved.

- For example, if Mary’s objective is to improve her sales prospecting skills, one key result might be to spend two hours a week shadowing Jennifer, the team member who demonstrates the most prospecting success.

Ability for people to look at every day:

- This consistency turns goal-setting into a habit and changes how people think about their work and approach their everyday to-dos.

- It puts in place natural milestones that make you think about what you need to do next and aim high.

Ability to stretch:

- You want objectives to be ambitious enough to push you beyond your limits.

- When everyone does this, it forces tough conversations about what's truly needed for expectations.

- Most people wouldn’t consider 70% to be a good grade, but for OKRs that’s perfect.
